                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Hyrum Morales from Quetzaltenango, Guatemala! I’m passionate about software development and
                    currently studying it online to improve my skills and achieve a better quality of life. I enjoy
                    working remotely, which gives me the flexibility to balance my love for basketball, dancing, and
                    playing video games. My favorite foods are BBQ, sushi, and tacos, and I find joy in relaxing at the
                    beach whenever I can. With a strong dedication to growth and learning, I’m excited to make a
                    positive impact in my career and personal life.</p>
